This project was completed using an AWS Free Tier EC2 instance, with a simple LAMP stack installed. You can view the project here:

The project references a simple DB with a table 'todo' that holds todo task data. You can add a task with the 'Create Task' button, which will launch a modal window so you can enter the task data. From the task list view, you can move items up and down the list with the 'move up' and 'move down' links. These links will resequence the list accordingly, and will also update the database via an AJAX call.
